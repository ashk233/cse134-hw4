1. Implemeted a hamburger menu which shows on small screens (less than 640px). I added it because this is an essential component of adaptive design. I didn't do this in the previous homework since it is easier to do with JavaScript.
2. Add Google Analytics to track user activity. This 3rd party script would be helpful if I can integrate it well, since it can provide insights about user experience, such as whether they fill in and submit the inquiry form after opening it, how long they spend reading each section, how often they use the navbar links, what section they jump to frequently throught navbar, etc.
